    <li>The point of the game is to connect the dots without them intersecting with eachother and also covering all the grid boxes, you will need to open your developer tools to be able to check win conditions or failed connections. When one dot of the same colour is connected to another, In your developer tools, it will say "connected" if a dot you are dragging is stopped half way, it will move back to its original position and say "failed". Once all the dots are connected in the correct way. It will say "You won"</li>
